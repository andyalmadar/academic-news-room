# academic-hotels

*Like every project starting with "academic-", this was an exercise of a course I'm taking right now or I took before because it finished.*

This application fetches news from an external API (Canillitapp) and then shows them in a list with a mosaic layout. The user has the possibility of filtering by category or doing a custom search if he/she wants to.
The app has a dark/light mode toggler too. It's located at the top-left part of the header.

There are some issues related with the responsive design which had been left unresolved.
